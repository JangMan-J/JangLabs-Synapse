# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

**Core value:** The right memory surfaces at the right moment with zero human curation — and the whole system stays legible and maximum-punch-per-pound while doing it.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — telemetry-self-curation

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (telemetry-self-curation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-12 -- Phase 03 Plan 02 complete (CUR-03 delivered)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 36%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 6 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 6 min | 6 min |
| 02 | 4 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (6 min), 01-02 (9 min), 01-03 (7 min)
- Trend: stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Routing-led sequencing: routing core (Phases 1-2) before curation (Phase 3) and reorganization (Phase 4)
- MIG-01 gate is the first deliverable of Phase 1; old routing path stays live until the gate passes in Phase 2
- Clean slate for routing metadata; memory content preserved (~140 memories routable at cutover, MIG-02)
- Zero human curation: Roulette retires in Phase 3 only after automated maintenance pass validated against it (CUR-04)
- [01-01] Grammar file uses #### spec headings so grep -c '^### ' counts only tag entries (not spec prose)
- [01-01] validate_grammar returns [] on missing _grammar.md — fail-open consistent with all existing parsers
- [Phase ?]: [01-02] triggers nested under metadata: — consistent with top-level tags: rejection (D-07)
- [Phase ?]: [01-02] D-09 enforcement fail-opens for no-frontmatter content (no ---...--- block = not a structured memory)
- [Phase ?]: [01-03] DEDUP_BACKSTOP_THRESHOLD = 0.85 (conservative — near-certain duplicates only; pinned by contract tests)
- [Phase ?]: [01-03] _classify_target extended to box|project-store|repo-memory|other; non-box skips triggers requirement
- [Phase ?]: [01-03] write_context() never raises — any exception returns "" (context hook must not block)
- [Phase ?]: [01-04] Guard TYPE=grammar arm uses validate-grammar with bootstrap allowance (same pattern as taxonomy arm)
- [Phase ?]: [01-04] Hook fixture assertions must match engine MEMORY_SURFACE_DIR behavior: placement deny names fixture store, assert 'box-placement' not '.claude/projects'
- [Phase ?]: [01-04] Dedup backstop fires on new-file targets only — fixture allow case writes to existing file (consolidation is the intended resolution path)
- [02-01] Mechanical fallback (D-29b) implemented as index-side entries only (byMemoryId), not frontmatter writes — keeps store-is-source/index-is-binary principle clean
- [02-01] _review_game.py cmd_keep/cmd_later/cmd_refresh intentionally do NOT call rebuild() — they touch only review metadata, not routing inputs; CORE-08 satisfied without it
- [02-01] Open Question 2 resolved: bare comma-tags memory parses with 2 tags via _parse_flow_tags() and routes correctly; no fix needed
- [Phase ?]: 02-02: Token-routing table pinned spec-first: command/unit→strong; arg→strong/medium/weak; tag→strong/weak; package/path→weak; full paths via byPath→strong (D-25/D-27)
- [Phase ?]: [02-02] TIER_WEIGHTS not in DEFAULT_CONFIG — merged inside search_new only; keeps existing config schema untouched
- [Phase ?]: [02-02] Staged dispatch: search-new + MEMORY_SURFACE_SEARCH_IMPL=new; both deleted at Plan 02-04 flip (D-30)
- [02-03] jq consolidation recovers ~6ms (60ms→54ms p95); 4ms gap to 50ms gate remains at optimized floor — gate FAIL escalated to 02-04 MVR run
- [02-03] surfaceText extracted via @base64 in jq + base64 -d in shell for safe multiline/← round-trip (T-02-13)
- [02-03] Unit separator (0x1f) as IFS delimiter for pre-Python field extraction — safe for all tool/path/command values
- [Phase ?]: D-30 flip complete: search() IS the trigger-index matcher; legacy path removed in single revertable commit 392f351; parse_tag_links() retained for write-path (deferred deletion)
- [Phase 03]: [03-01] Timestamp format: ISO-8601 UTC via TZ=UTC0 printf -v bash builtin; 03-02 parser uses fromisoformat() — Fork-free bash builtin confirmed working; zero subprocess spawns
- [Phase 03]: [03-01] _TEL_MAX=1048576 shell constant — saves ~3ms vs per-fire config jq spawn against ~1ms p95 headroom — Discretion-chosen constant documented in hook comment
- [Phase 03]: [03-01] mems flat shape: per-evidenceTuple {id,tag,type,val}; zero-tuple results get sentinel element for fire-count — Ensures D-43 fire-counting never loses a memory
- [Phase 03]: [03-02] Decay formula: rectangular window (records inside telemetryWindowDays count equally; older count zero) — legible, jq-auditable, pinned by contract test
- [Phase 03]: [03-02] Session marker before at-$HOME skip — all sessions contribute to telemetry threshold count; D-44 summary discarded for $HOME sessions (no floor block)
- [Phase 03]: [03-02] jq for state/config reads in hook — avoids Python spawn on no-op path; negative delta = rotation reset -> use cur_lines

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Read-signal proxy ("session read the file") needs validation against action-changed; flagged for in-phase research
- [Project] Budgeted parallelism: no serious parallel run without a declared dispatch checkpoint (N agents × model)

*(Resolved 2026-06-12: Phase 1 dark-memory placement fixed — ORG-04 complete. Phase 2 p95 budget closed — gate recalibrated to ≤55ms operator-approved, new path measures 48–54ms.)*
